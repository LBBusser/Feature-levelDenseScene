# Interleaved feature-level autoregressive fusion for in-context dense scene understanding

In recent years, few-shot learning and in-context learning have garnered significant attention for their potential to enhance the adaptability and performance of machine learning models with minimal data. However, the large size of these foundational models, typically consisting of billions of parameters, poses a challenge for smaller clients. This research investigates the application of in-context learning paradigms within an efficient and lightweight design framework, employing a multi-faceted pipeline that integrates several off-the-shelf components. We introduce the first small scale interleaved autoregressive feature-level fusion pipeline capable of in-context dense scene understanding.
By leveraging the rich representations of pre-trained vision encoders, like DINOv2 and VQ-gan, we are able to efficiently combine the information. Using this feature fusion we train an autoregressive vision transformer, image GPT, to perform dense scene understanding tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation. The proposed pipeline demonstrates an initial attempt to enhance scene understanding capabilities in smaller models, paving the way for more accessible generalist vision models capable of robust performance across a variety of complex tasks. This work shows an improvement in semantic segmentation and depth estimation over previous work showcasing efficient in-context scene understanding. Finally, this work also highlights the shortcomings of the design and provides future directions to improve such small-scale scene understanding vision models.
